# Work log

Newest first. One entry per prompt, written by the session that did the work. Checkpoints and
the final review read this first, so keep entries short and exact. Questions for Ali go here
too, so nothing is lost when a session ends.

Entry format:

```
## <date> - Prompt <N> <ID> <title>
- Commit: <hash> | Model: <model>, <effort>
- Changed: <files>
- Checks: tests (count), build time, fingerprint (parts changed), budgets when relevant
- Look: <picture path or view> - what to see
- Doubts and questions for Ali: <none, or the question>
```

## 2026-10-22 - Prompt 3 T3 Housekeeping
- Commit: (this commit) | Model: Sonnet, low
- Changed: citygen/city/geo.py, citygen/__main__.py, requirements.txt, docs/SPEC.md, docs/ROADMAP.md, .claude/agents/city-builder.md, city-checker.md
- Checked: tests 20 passed (8 s, no warnings), quick build 7 s, fingerprint 142 parts 0 changed.
- Note: editing .claude/agents needed the sandbox off.

## 2026-10-22 - Prompt 2 T2 Before/after pictures
- Commit: see git log | Model: Sonnet, medium
- Changed: tools/before_after.py (new), tools/viewer/index.html (camera ground clamp only after all tiles loaded), docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/SPEC.md, docs/ROADMAP.md
- Checks: tests and quick build, see commit. Unchanged tree: street, souk, aerial, --cam/--look and --kit-sheet --frame awning_red all 0.00. Dark `leaf` (reverted): 1.62.
- Look: output/checks/t2-street.png, t2-souk.png, t2-aerial.png, t2-cam.png, t2-kit.png, t2-leaf.png (leaf test)
- Doubts and questions for Ali: found and fixed a viewer bug: the camera was lifted to the lowest loaded tile + 1 m while tiles were still loading, so the same world gave different pictures per run. Without the fix an unchanged tree showed a difference of 36-75. The before half copies the working tree's viewer, so both halves match.

## 2026-10-22 - Prompt 1 T1 Regression fingerprint
- Commit: see git log | Model: Sonnet, medium
- Changed: tools/fingerprint.py (new), citygen/kit.py (`make_kit`), citygen/mesh/tile.py, citygen/kitsheet.py, tests/test_citygen.py, docs/SPEC.md, docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/ROADMAP.md
- Checks: 19 tests pass, quick build 6.6 s, two identical builds: "140 parts, 0 changed". Test: `clumps` 7,8 -> 6,7 in broadleaf changed only 9 parts (tiles/*, tiles/index, kit/tree_broadleaf_c, e.g. "kit/tree_broadleaf_c: triangles 164 -> 144", "tiles/tile_13_23.glb: bytes 4646196 -> 4644684, triangles 67697 -> 67637"); styles restored.
- Look: no
- Doubts and questions for Ali: none

## 2026-10-21 - Lead session: the playbook
- Commit: the "Playbook" commit | Model: Opus, high
- Changed: docs/PROMPTS.md (index), docs/prompts/01-09 (100 prompts), docs/ROADMAP.md
  (checklist), docs/WORKLOG.md (this file), CLAUDE.md (prompt routine), docs/WORKFLOW.md,
  docs/HANDOFF.md
- Checks: docs only. Two independent Opus reviews checked every prompt against the code (80
  findings, all valid ones applied); prompts 20.1 and 20.2 were added because many homes have no
  door or windows today (`Dresser.facades` needs a street within 1.6 m).
- Look: docs/PROMPTS.md
- Doubts and questions for Ali: none

## 2026-10-21 - Lead session: Q1 Natural leafy trees
- Commit: dcaac69 | Model: Sonnet helper, Opus review
- Changed: citygen/mesh/trees.py (new), mesh/props.py, kit.py, kitsheet.py, mesh/tile.py,
  styles/maghreb.toml, tests, docs
- Checks: 18 tests; tiles 11.55 to 11.65 MB (+0.9%); the 58 other kit pieces identical
- Look: before/after boulevard picture (pointed diamonds became rounded, shaded crowns)
- Doubts and questions for Ali: none

## 2026-10-21 - Lead session: Q2 Family names
- Commit: df3e57e (and 778ad09: .gitignore for .DS_Store) | Model: Sonnet helper, Opus review
- Changed: city/life.py, names.py, styles/maghreb.toml [life], tests, docs
- Checks: 17 tests; only family names changed (tiles, world and plan without names identical)
- Look: 30 sample names; Ali accepted them
- Doubts and questions for Ali: none
