# Handoff - the project's memory

Read this once when you start on a new machine, or when a task needs background. Everyday
rules are in `CLAUDE.md`, tasks in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, technical rules in `docs/SPEC.md`, cost
advice in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, ready prompts in `docs/PROMPTS.md`.

## The owner

- **Ali**, a mechatronics engineer who also does 3D (Blender 5.2 on a Mac), video and stories.
  Not a software developer: answer in plain language (about B2 English), define jargon, keep
  reports short, and walk through screenshots step by step. Speaks English, French and Arabic.
- Never write the em dash character anywhere (code, docs, commits, answers); use "-".
- His weekly token limit matters. Efficiency is a requirement, but never at the cost of quality.

## The goal

- A procedural generator (a program that builds everything from rules) for a huge invented
  Mediterranean / North African country, Tunisia-like but fictional. It serves games, stories,
  films and more. Agents improve the code; the code builds the world for free.
- Why procedural and not hand-made or AI images: the same seed always gives the same world
  (stories stay consistent), size is only computer time, sessions stay small and cheap, and
  standard glTF files open in Blender, Godot, Unity and Unreal.
- Castles, steampunk or vertical cities are styles on top of the same plan layer (tasks F1-F4),
  not a different project.
- End point: golden-hour streets with textured walls, rich street life, and houses with real
  interiors when a scene needs them (tasks H1-H4).
- Audience: worldwide, but authentically North African. Names must sound Maghrebi (Arabic and
  Berber). Ali saw early names that sounded Hebrew and asked to fix them: `citygen/names.py`
  filters spellings and a test guards it. Arabic script comes with task D5.
- Team: Ali plus Claude. Everything is built so a small team could scale it later (style packs,
  kits, small roadmap tasks).
- **Tounes Rush** is Ali's three.js runner game (claude.ai artifact "Tounes Rush AAA V5.2").
  Its 3D pieces live in `kits/tounes/`, so both projects share one look. Task C6 will export
  run routes from generated cities for the game.

## Where things stand (October 2026)

- Done: v0.1 (country, cities, maps, data, 3D tiles, viewer, Blender scripts), **A0** (Tounes
  kit, street dressing, households and souk trades, night mode, "click a house: who lives there")
  **Q2** (family names that sound Tunisian) and **Q1** (rounded, shaded leafy trees).
- Since 21 October 2026 the work runs on Ali's Mac: an Opus lead session plans and reviews, the
  `city-builder` helper codes one task at a time in the order of `docs/PROMPTS.md`, and Ali says
  "next" before each new task.
- Seed 42 makes the country **Bodjantouna** with the capital **Goumosbane**.
  `python -m citygen build --quick` writes it to `output/bodjantouna-42/` in about 7 seconds on
  Ali's Mac (20 seconds in the cloud).
- All work is on the git branch `claude/procedural-city-generator-xop72h`. Keep working on it and
  push at the end of every task (GitHub is the backup).
- 3D page for the phone (made from the quick build):
  https://claude.ai/artifact/HMtdFZUV9sGmyPn4q8mKsq . Rebuild it with `tools/make_artifact.py`
  after a big visual step, then publish the folder to that same link from a Claude session.

## Decisions and lessons (do not relearn them)

- **Randomness** only from `citygen.rng.stream(seed, *purpose)`, one purpose path per feature, so
  adding a feature never changes the rest of the world.
- **Family names** mix real lists with made-up nisba names built from Arabic roots and patterns
  (Hamdi = 1a23i from H-M-D), with sound rules and a rude-word blocklist, because random syllables
  sounded Japanese or Italian. D5 can map roots and patterns to Arabic script.
- **Street dressing** (`city/dressing.py`) is built tile by tile from kit pieces and never stored
  in the plan. Which piece plays each part is data: `[dressing.roles]` in `styles/maghreb.toml`.
  Kit pieces are named `<kit>/<piece>`; anchors are explained in `mesh/props.py` and SPEC 6b.
- **Instancing** (`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`): one model drawn many times keeps tiles small.
  Blender 3.6 does not read it, Blender 4 and 5 do; `tools/blender_import.py` handles both.
- **Thin cloth and canvas** need real faces on both sides (`add_sheet` in `mesh/builder.py`):
  a double-sided material alone showed black undersides.
- **Vertex colors** are written as 8-bit RGBA (a quarter of the size of floats).
- **Night mode** in the viewer: materials with an `emissive` color glow; window glass
  (`glass_dark`) lights up; the nearest lamps get real lights. Kit windows stay dark.
- **Blender 5**: the physical sky is `MULTIPLE_SCATTERING` with `aerosol_density`; the
  compositor moved to node groups, so the beauty render skips its haze there (task Q4).
- **Leafy trees** (`mesh/trees.py`) are instanced kit pieces, three variants per kind, each with its
  own stream. Undressed tiles keep the light 3-clump tree from `tree_mesh`: merging 200-triangle
  trees 7,900 times into a tile would make it huge.
- **Headless snapshots** run on the CPU and are slow. Use a small `radius` in `--query`.
- **Old-town tiles** reach about 5 MB with all the dressing (SPEC budget note; task Q5).

## Known weak spots

Listed as tasks Q3-Q5 in the roadmap: a crude generated bougainvillea, no haze in Blender 5
beauty renders, heavy old-town tiles.

## Checking the look without wasting tokens

- Best: Ali looks himself. `python -m citygen view` opens the browser (camera spots in the top
  menu, Night button, click a house). Or open the tiles in Blender:
  `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --python tools/blender_import.py -- output/bodjantouna-42/tiles`
- Claude takes at most two snapshots per task (`python -m citygen snapshot --view street`; views
  street = the boulevard, souk, aerial, top), then stops and asks Ali. On Ali's Mac `.venv` has
  playwright 1.56.0 because it matches the Chromium already in `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`
  (newer versions want a new download of about 250 MB). In a sandboxed Claude session the
  snapshot's small local web server needs local port binding: run it outside the sandbox, or set
  `sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding: true`.
- Every piece of the kit in one grid: `python -m citygen kit-sheet`, then
  `python -m citygen view output/kit-sheet`.
