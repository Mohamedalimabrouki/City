# citygen - technical spec

This is the contract every change must respect. Read the sections your task touches.

## 1. Principles

1. **The code builds the world.** No hand-made map data. A world is fully defined by
   `seed + settings + style pack`; the same inputs always give byte-identical outputs.
2. **Coarse to fine.** The country (terrain, settlements, roads) is cheap and computed whole.
   Cities are planned only when needed. 3D tiles are built only for the requested area.
3. **Local output.** A tile can be built without the rest of the country's tiles, so huge
   worlds stream in a game engine and build in parallel.
4. **Content is data.** Names, colors, district rules and building rules live in
   `styles/*.toml`; world settings live in `citygen/defaults.toml` and `worlds/*.toml`.
5. **Fast feedback.** `pytest` about 20 s, `build --quick` about 1 min. Keep it that way.

## 2. Coordinates and units

- Meters. Generator axes: **x = east, y = north, z = up**. The country spans `0..size` on x and y.
- Angles in code: radians, counter-clockwise from east. Angles in settings: compass bearings in
  degrees (0 = north, 90 = east), converted with `radians(90 - bearing)`.
- glTF export (only there): `(x, y, z) -> (x, z, -y)`, so +Y is up and north is -Z.
- UVs are in meters (1 UV unit = 1 m) for walls, roofs, terrain and roads.

## 3. Determinism

- All randomness: `citygen.rng.stream(seed, *path)` returns a numpy Generator keyed by a
  purpose path, e.g. `stream(seed, "city", city_id, "parcels", block_index)`.
- Each feature gets its own path, so adding a feature never reshuffles existing ones.
  Inside a city, use `ctx.rng(*path)` (already prefixed with the city).
- Never use the `random` module, unseeded numpy, wall-clock time, or set/dict order that
  depends on hashing of unsorted keys.
- Noise (`citygen.noise.Perlin`, `Fractal`) is a pure function of position.

## 4. Pipeline and modules

```
config.load_config()          defaults.toml + worlds/*.toml + CLI overrides
  world.generate_world()      terrain.Terrain, settlements, roads (whole country, seconds)
    city.plan_city()          one settlement -> CityPlan (seconds to a minute)
      layout                  land polygon, city limit, old town outline, neighborhoods, kinds
      medina                  great mosque, gates, souks, alleys (spanning tree), ramparts
      streets                 arterials (neighborhood borders), ring road, boulevard,
                              corniche, links to country roads, local grids, street trees
      parcels                 blocks = district minus street surfaces; recursive lot split
      buildings               per-district building rules, mosques, parks, cemetery
  mesh.tile.export_tile()     one 512 m square -> .glb (terrain, water, roads, city)
  export.maps / export.lore   PNG maps, world.json, plan.json, gazetteer.md
build.build()                 orchestrates the above into output/<country>-<seed>/
```

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `citygen/rng.py` | keyed random streams, weighted choice |
| `citygen/noise.py` | Perlin and fractal noise, smoothstep |
| `citygen/terrain.py` | height, moisture, slope, biome classes |
| `citygen/names.py` | invented names from the style's sounds |
| `citygen/world.py` | `World`, `Settlement`, `Road`; placement and road routing (Dijkstra on a cost grid) |
| `citygen/city/*.py` | the city planner (see pipeline) |
| `citygen/mesh/builder.py` | mesh primitives: extrude, walls, caps, domes, hip roofs, ribbons, trees |
| `citygen/mesh/gltf.py` | dependency-free .glb writer and reader |
| `citygen/mesh/tile.py` | what goes into one tile |
| `citygen/export/maps.py` | country and city PNG maps |
| `citygen/export/lore.py` | JSON data files and the gazetteer |
| `citygen/build.py` | area selection and the full build |
| `citygen/view.py`, `tools/` | browser viewer, snapshot, Blender import |

## 5. Data model (`citygen/city/model.py`, `citygen/world.py`)

- `Settlement(id, name, kind, x, y, population, radius, elevation, coastal, biome, known_for, founded)`;
  kinds: `capital`, `city`, `town`, `village`. Ids are stable for a given seed and settings.
- `Road(id, kind, width, coords, ends)`; kinds `national`, `regional`, `local`.
- `CityPlan`: `boundary`, `land`, `medina`, `districts`, `streets`, `blocks`, `parcels`,
  `buildings`, `trees`, `landmarks`, `stats`.
- `District.kind`: `medina`, `village`, `colonial`, `modern`, `residential`, `suburb`,
  `industrial`, `port`, `park`, `cemetery`.
- `Street.kind`: `boulevard`, `arterial`, `ring`, `corniche`, `connector`, `street`, `souk`, `alley`.
- `Building`: `footprint` (holes = courtyards), `kind`, `height` (above the highest ground
  point), `wall`/`roof` material names, `floors`, `roof_shape` (`flat`/`hip`), `domes`, `top`.

Invariants (tested): buildings are valid polygons inside the city and stay off street surfaces;
everything is deterministic.

## 6. Output files (`output/<country>-<seed>/`)

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `world.json` | `citygen-world/1`: seed, name, size, settlements, roads (coords in meters) |
| `cities/<name>/plan.json` | `citygen-city/1`: districts, streets, buildings, trees, landmarks; GeoJSON-style geometry in world meters |
| `gazetteer.md` | readable guide for stories |
| `maps/country.png`, `maps/<city>.png` | 2D maps, north up |
| `tiles/tile_<i>_<j>.glb` | 3D tile covering x `i*512..(i+1)*512`, y `j*512..(j+1)*512` |
| `tiles/index.json` | `citygen-tiles/1`: tile list, sizes, triangle counts, `focus` point |
| `summary.json` | counts and timings (read this instead of big files) |

**.glb conventions:** one root node per tile with `translation = [x0, 0, -y0]`; vertices are
local to it. One primitive per material; material names are palette names from the style pack
(colors are written linear, palettes are sRGB hex). A building or tree belongs to the tile that
contains its center, so tiles never duplicate objects. Terrain edges match between neighbors.

## 7. Style pack (`styles/<name>.toml`)

`[names]` sounds and templates, `[lore]` eras and products, `[palette]` materials,
`[district.<kind>]` street grid, lot size, floors, materials and special rules,
`[settlement.<kind>]` population, density, old town size, which district kinds exist and the
`rings` mix by distance from the center. Adding a style = a new file; code must not assume
Maghreb-specific values.

## 8. Performance budgets

| Step | Budget |
|---|---|
| `pytest -q` | under 30 s |
| `build --quick` | under 90 s |
| country (64 km) | under 10 s |
| capital plan (about 60k buildings) | under 60 s |
| one tile | under 5 s, under 3 MB |

## 9. Checking results cheaply

- `python -m citygen stats` prints `summary.json`.
- Maps: `output/*/maps/*.png` (look at the image, not the data files).
- 3D: `python -m citygen snapshot --view aerial|street|top` renders the viewer to a PNG.

## 10. Extending

- **New district kind:** add `[district.<kind>]` to the style, a branch in
  `city/buildings.make_buildings`, a color in `export/maps.py`, and put it in a settlement's
  `rings` mix or in `layout.assign_kinds`.
- **New building shape:** a function in `mesh/builder.py`, used from `mesh/tile.building_mesh`
  via a new `roof_shape` or field on `Building`.
- **New props (benches, boats, cars):** add a list on `CityPlan`, fill it in the planner, mesh it
  in `mesh/tile.build_tile` with the same "center decides the tile" rule.
